Genomes of all characterized higher eukaryotes harbor examples
of transposable element (TE) bursts—the rapid amplification of TE
copies throughout a genome. Despite their prevalence, understanding how bursts diversify genomes requires the characterization of actively transposing TEs before insertion sites and
structural rearrangements have been obscured by selection acting
over evolutionary time. In this study, rice recombinant inbred lines
(RILs), generated by crossing a bursting accession and the reference Nipponbare accession, were exploited to characterize the
spread of the very active Ping/mPing family through a small population and the resulting impact on genome diversity. Comparative sequence analysis of 272 individuals led to the identification
of over 14,000 new insertions of the mPing miniature invertedrepeat transposable element (MITE), with no evidence for silencing
of the transposase-encoding Ping element. In addition to new insertions, Ping-encoded transposase was found to preferentially
catalyze the excision of mPing loci tightly linked to a second mPing
insertion. Similarly, structural variations, including deletion of rice
exons or regulatory regions, were enriched for those with break
points at one or both ends of linked mPing elements. Taken together, these results indicate that structural variations are generated during a TE burst as transposase catalyzes both the high copy
numbers needed to distribute linked elements throughout the genome and the DNA cuts at the TE ends known to dramatically
increase the frequency of recombination.

member of the PIF/Harbinger superfamily of class II elements,
and the miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE)
mPing (10). MITEs are a subset of nonautonomous DNA elements characterized by their short length (<600 base pairs [bp])
and ability to amplify from one or a few elements to hundreds or
thousands of copies (11, 12). MITEs are the most abundant TEs
associated with the genes of higher plants where they populate
noncoding regions (introns, 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences) and are a
major contributor to allelic diversity (13, 14). While most characterized rice accessions have 0 to 1 Ping and 1 to 50 mPings (15), the
four accessions have 7 to 10 Pings, ∼230 to 500 mPings, and up to
∼40 new mPing insertions per plant per generation (7–9).
Prior studies of the four inbred accessions where the Ping/
mPing family has been active over decades revealed key features
of successful bursts (9). First, although mPing has a preference
for genic insertion sites, it can dramatically increase in copy
number without having a major impact on the phenotype because of its preference for AT-rich target sites while rice exons
are GC-rich (8, 16). Thus, mPing rarely inserts into rice exons
(8). Second, because mPing is a deletion derivative of Ping but
does not share any coding sequences, host recognition of mPing
does not silence Ping expression (9). Despite robust host epigenetic regulation, the bursts have been ongoing for decades and

Significance
Transposable elements (TEs) represent the largest component
of the genomes of higher eukaryotes. Among this component
are some TEs that have attained very high copy numbers, with
hundreds, even thousands, of elements. By documenting the
spread of mPing elements throughout the genomes of a rice
population, we demonstrate that such bursts of amplification
generate functionally relevant genomic variations upon which
selection can act. Specifically, continued mPing amplification
increases the number of tightly linked elements that, in turn,
increases the frequency of structural variations that appear to
be derived from aberrant transposition events. The significance
of this finding is that it provides a TE-mediated mechanism that
may generate much of the structural variation represented by
pan-genomes in plants and other organisms.

T

ransposable elements (TEs) represent the largest component
of the genomes of higher eukaryotes, comprising almost 50%
of the human genome and over 80% of many plant genomes
(1–4). Making up the TE component are hundreds, sometimes
thousands, of TE families, containing autonomous elements
(encoding the enzymes that catalyze transposition) and the more
numerous nonautonomous members (5). A subset of TE families
attain very high copy numbers, with hundreds, thousands, even
tens of thousands of copies (5). Phylogenetic analysis of high
copy number family members often reveals a star-phylogeny,
indicative of a burst of amplification that is repressed (either by
mutation or host-mediated silencing), and then the sequences of
all copies drift into oblivion (5).
The prevalence of evidence for ancient bursts in plant and
animal genomes implies that TE families have evolved mechanisms to insert copies throughout the genome while avoiding
host silencing (6). To unravel these mechanisms requires the
identification of TE families that are in the midst of a burst—
where the biochemical features responsible for successful amplification are still active and their insertion sites have not been
obscured by negative selection acting over evolutionary time.
To determine the features of a successful burst, we characterized the Ping/mPing TE family, found to be amplifying in four
accessions (EG4, HEG4, A119, and A123) of Oryza sativa (rice)
(7–9). The TE family is comprised of the autonomous Ping, a

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of RIL construction. The RIL population was
constructed by crossing NB (maternal) with HEG4 (paternal). Two F1 plants
(no. 26 and no. 27) were used to breed F2s via self-pollination. F2 progeny
were self-crossed for nine generations to develop the RILs. HEG4 contains
7 Pings and 422 mPings whereas NB contains 1 Ping and 51 mPings. After 10
generations of self-pollination, Ping and mPing elements from HEG4 (blue
stars) and NB (red stars) segregated in the RILs; new mPing/Ping transpositions (green stars) are not in the RIL parents.

are likely to continue until Ping transposes into a region that
elicits host silencing or the TE load destabilizes the genome (9).
The focus of this study is another dimension of the mPing
burst, that being impacts of its spread through a population.
While TE bursts are rare phenomena, invasions of naive populations by TE bursts in real time are exceedingly rare, with the
most prominent example being the worldwide invasion of Drosophila melanogaster and, more recently, Drosophila simulans by
P elements (17, 18). All available evidence indicates that bursts
of both P elements and the Ping/mPing family occurred during
the past century (9, 17, 18); however, significant increases in
mPing copy number are likely restricted to a few related accessions as no bursts were detected in over 3,000 sequenced rice
accessions (15, 19). This likely reflects the fact that, unlike D.
melanogaster, which is a wild species and an outcrosser, rice is a
domesticated crop that propagates by self- or sib-pollination.
In this study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population,
previously constructed to assess the phenotypic consequences of
mPing insertions (20), was repurposed to model the spread of the
Ping/mPing burst. The parents of the population were the reference Nipponbare (NB) (where the Ping/mPing family rarely
transposes) and HEG4, one of the four bursting accessions. F1s
from this initial cross were used to establish 272 inbred lines following 10 generations of self- or sib-pollination (Fig. 1). As such,
the RIL population serves as a proxy for the spread of a TE burst
in a largely selfing species. Of note was that burst activity was
maintained throughout the population as there was no evidence of
silencing. In addition, comparative analysis of RIL genome sequences provided a high-resolution picture of the extent of diversity generated by a TE burst, including mPing insertions,
excisions, and structural rearrangements.
Results
Sequence and Analysis of Recombination Map in the RIL Population.

A collection of 272 RILs derived from a cross between accessions
Chen et al.

HEG4 and NB (Materials and Methods) were sequenced using
Illumina paired-end reads. A total of ∼1 Tb (terrabase) of sequences were generated with an average depth of ∼11-fold coverage per RIL (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A and Supplementary Data 1).
Sequence reads from each RIL were aligned to the NB reference
genome (MSUv7) (21), and the genotype was scored for the
105,900 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
distinguish the parents (9). This approach determined 93.5% of
parental SNP genotypes in every RIL, ranging from 60.9 to 99.7%
(SI Appendix, Fig. S1B and Supplementary Data 1). Recombination bins were inferred using a hidden Markov model (HMM)
approach (22). The resulting recombination map contained 2,572
bins and an average bin length of 142.76 kilobases (kb) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C and Table S1), which is comparable to other
sequenced RIL populations in rice (23, 24) and enabled efficient
quantitative trait locus (QTL) dissection of genetic loci controlling
mPing transposition.
De Novo mPing and Ping Insertion Sites. The genomic locations of
mPing elements in each RIL were determined with RelocaTE2
(25). A total of 87,450 mPing insertions were identified across
the 272 RILs and simplified to 16,914 unique mPing loci in the
population (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2). Of
these 16,914 loci, 3% were parental while the remaining 16,448,
or 97% of mPing loci in the population were nonparental and
defined herein as de novo insertions. Among the de novo insertions, 88% (14,534 of 16,448) are unique to a single individual, indicating that most new insertions occurred during or after
the F2 generations that produced the recombinant inbreds
(Table 1). The rest of the de novo insertions (1,914 of 16,448) are
shared among 2 to 145 RILs, representing either early insertions
that occurred in F1 or late insertions that share target sites in the
genome (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Of those found in a single individual, 72% (10,527 of 14,534) are homozygous and likely
transposed in early generations of RIL self-pollination while the
remaining 28% (4,007 of 14,534) are heterozygous (Table 1) and
represent either more recent mPing insertions or mPing alleles
that are lethal or less fit when homozygous. To distinguish these
possibilities, SNPs flanking heterozygous mPing loci were analyzed
to determine genotypes of genomic regions underlying mPing insertions as recent insertions are more likely to be in homozygous
(inbred) regions. Of the 4,007 heterozygous insertions, we were
able to unambiguously genotype 2,964, of which 96% (2,864 of
2,964) were homozygous (SI Appendix, Table S2). These data
suggest that the vast majority of heterozygous mPing insertions are
late events. Finally, like previously reported de novo mPing insertions (7, 8), 45% of all insertions (both homozygous and heterozygous) identified in this study are within 5 kb upstream of
protein-coding genes (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
Analysis of Ping elements identified only 17 nonparental (de
novo) Pings, and over half of these (8 of 17) are within 5 kb of
protein-coding genes (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S3).
Among the population, RIL270 had two de novo Ping insertions
(SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2) while each of the 15 RILs
had a single new Ping insertion. De novo Ping insertions were
only found in RILs with two or more parental Ping loci (SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2).
Correlation between Ping Copy Number and Number of New mPing
Insertions. Among the 272 RILs, significant variation (0 to 138)

was found in the number of unique mPing insertions (from here
on restricted to de novo unique homozygous mPing insertions)
(SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2), suggesting that multiple
genetic loci control mPing transposition activity. To identify these
loci, QTL mapping was performed using the number of unique
mPing insertions as the trait (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Three major loci
were identified with the logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores greater
than 3.31 and accounting for 49% of the phenotypic variation

(SI Appendix, Fig. S5 and Table S4). Two of these loci contain
multiple Ping elements (PingA and PingB on chromosome 1 and
PingE, PingF, and PingG on chromosome 9), confirming prior data
that all bursting accessions had multiple Pings (7–10 Pings) (9). A
third QTL located on chromosome 4 (accounting for 11.82% of
phenotypic variance) does not contain a Ping element (SI Appendix,
Fig. S5 and Table S4), suggesting that additional factors may contribute to the rate of transposition. These potential host factors are
beyond the scope of this study and will not be further discussed.
To date, quantification of the impact of Ping loci on mPing
transposition has been restricted to accessions with either the
single Ping locus in NB (PingH) or the collective impact of the 7 to
10 Ping loci in the bursting accessions (HEG4, EG4, A123, and
A119) (9). In NB, mPing rarely transposes, and Ping transcript
levels are very low (9). In contrast, there is significant amplification of mPing and transcription of Ping in the accessions with 7 to
10 Pings, including the RIL parent, HEG4 (9). This population
allows for higher resolution analyses of Ping copy number and
transposition and transcription activity because the eight parental
Pings are segregating and, theoretically, should contain most
combinations of Ping loci (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). In fact, several
RILs were found to contain from 0 to 8 Ping loci, and a positive
correlation was found to exist between Ping copy number and the
number of new mPing insertions (Fig. 2A) (two-tailed Pearson’s
correlation test, r = 0.71, P = 1e−42). For example, there are
approximately 5 unique mPing insertions in RILs with one Ping
whereas RIL with seven Ping elements have, on average, 65

Ping Activity at Eight Different Loci. The RIL population provided a
unique opportunity to explore the activity of various combinations
of the eight segregating Ping loci present in the two parents. This
was of particular interest because, although all Ping elements are
identical, one Ping locus has been implicated in initiating the
bursts (9, 15). Specifically, PingA_Stow on chromosome 1 (called
PingA in this study) was shown previously to be the only Ping
shared by the four bursting accessions (9) and found preferentially
in the genomes of rice accessions with higher than background
mPing copies (15). Taken together, these correlative data suggest
that the PingA locus differs from the other Ping loci, perhaps by
catalyzing more transposition.
The activity of individual Ping loci was quantified by first
identifying RIL with one Ping. Among the RIL population are 23
lines with a single Ping that, collectively, harbor all parental Pings
except PingF. PingA is present as a single Ping locus in RIL60.
Because mPing rarely transposes in accessions with one Ping (like
NB), two high-resolution independent methodologies, transposon
display and deep sequencing, were employed to assess the number
of new mPing insertions.
To identify new mPing insertions in individual progeny, transposon display (TD) was performed using DNA isolated from eight
plants derived by self-pollination from each analyzed single-Ping
RIL (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S7 and Table S5). The mPing
transposition activity was estimated by counting new amplicons
present in one individual but absent from its siblings. New mPing
insertions were detected in all single Ping RILs analyzed except
RIL179 (PingB) (Fig. 3A); however, the progeny of RIL60 (with
PingA), had significantly more (4 to 8 vs. 0 to 3 in the other singlePing RIL) (Fig. 3A) (one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s honestly
significant difference [HSD] test, P < 9.48e−8).
In the second approach, new insertions were directly counted
following deep sequencing of DNA samples isolated from eightpooled progeny of each RIL. Detection of new mPing insertions
for these RILs confirmed that all Pings tested are active, thus
providing a simple explanation for the Ping dosage series reported

above. Similarly, the finding that PingA promotes more transposition than the other Pings (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Table S6)
(one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD test, P < 3.09e−3) is consistent with the hypothesis that it initiated the bursts, but the underlying mechanism is beyond the scope of this study (Discussion).
Loss of Parental mPing Insertion Loci in the RIL Population. Ping and
mPing elements, like other DNA transposons, can both insert into
new loci and excise from existing sites. By tracking the fate of the
466 parental loci in the RIL population (44 from NB, 415 from
HEG4, and 7 shared) (Materials and Methods), we sought to determine whether some mPing loci were lost at a higher frequency
than others. Loss of TEs over time has been attributed to many
factors, the two most prominent being negative selection and
structural instability (26, 27). To discriminate between these possibilities, we developed methodologies to identify all parental
mPing excision events among the RIL population, determine excision frequencies at each locus, and analyze the genome context
of loci that excised frequently. To this end, we characterized empty
(excised) mPing sites in RILs within haplotype blocks classified by
parent of origin and expected to contain parental mPing loci
(Fig. 4A). On average, 127 RILs (ranging from 71 to 159) were
analyzed for each parental mPing.
In total, 742 excisions were detected from 177 parental mPing
loci (17 NB, 160 HEG4), and no excisions were detected from
the remaining 289 loci (34 NB, 255 HEG4). To validate the
Chen et al.

accuracy of the computer-assisted excision data, 30 loci were
randomly selected and assayed by PCR with DNA isolated from
the RIL where the excision was detected. Using this approach, 26
of 30 events were confirmed (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). Next, to
assess the excision frequency at each of the 177 parental loci, it
was necessary to establish the independence of the excision
events. For example, an excision event occurring early in the
generation of the RIL population might be propagated in several
RILs. Two approaches were used to eliminate dependent events:
1) a standard method where all excisions were analyzed after removal of early events, and 2) a conservative method where excision footprints were exploited to identify independent events. The
latter is likely to underestimate independent events because perfect excision, which is common for mPing, will only be counted
once per locus per RIL. Because both approaches produced very
similar results, only the conservative method is described below.
However, the results of both are found in Materials and Methods.
For the conservative method, 367 of the 742 excisions from
parental mPing loci have excision footprints (SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 3). This reduced to 322 independent events
following removal of excisions from the same locus with the same
footprint (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 3). Of
the 177 loci, 114 had only a single excision, 51 had fewer than
five (Fig. 4C), and 12 loci experienced five or more independent
excision events (Fig. 4C and SI Appendix, Table S7), which is
significantly more than expected by chance (two-tailed binomial
test, P = 7.1e−4). Significantly, a majority of these loci (7 of 12)
have another mPing insertion within 10 kb. Of these seven loci,
five have a nearby mPing in HEG4, including two pairs of high
frequency excision loci located close to each other (2.8 kb between Chr1:36267659 and Chr1:36270511; 2.6 kb between
Chr5:15210313 and Chr5:15213006) and one (Chr1:6806761)
located 9.6 kb from another parental mPing (Chr1:6816415) with
four independent excisions (Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Table S7).
Two of the seven loci have a nearby mPing (1.9 kb and 2.3 kb
away) that is not a parental locus but rather present in 45% of
the RILs (SI Appendix, Table S7). For the remaining 5 of 12 high
excision mPing loci, the nearest mPing is from 22.3 to 335.8 kb
(SI Appendix, Table S7). Taken together, these findings indicate
that the loss of mPing among the RILs can be attributable to
structural instability, not negative selection. In support of this
claim is the finding that expression analysis of the protein-coding
genes associated with the 12 high frequency excision loci identified only a single differentially expressed gene between the two
parental accessions (LOC_Os01g07300) (SI Appendix, Table S8).
mPing-Mediated Sequence Rearrangements. Another measure of
the impact of high copy mPings on genome stability is the number
of structural rearrangements in the RIL population and their
proximity to mPing insertions. A prior study, limited to a single
comparison between two accessions with high mPing copy numbers (HEG4 and EG4), identified a 120-kb inversion with multiple
mPing at the break point (9).
The RIL population, with 97% having 200 or more mPing copies
(SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2), provided an opportunity to
investigate the impact, if any, of an active burst on the generation of
structural rearrangements. A limitation of this analysis is that the
use of short sequence reads precludes the identification of inversions mediated by mPing or other TEs; only deletions and small
insertions (duplications) could be detected with confidence. Positions of rearrangements, irrespective of their proximity to mPing
elements, were determined by aligning and comparing RIL sequences with the NB reference genome using a read depth strategy implemented in CNVnator (28). Rearrangements only in the
RILs, were identified by first analyzing HEG4 using the same
method to detect and eliminate from consideration rearrangements in the parental accession. In total, 16 rearrangements (15
deletions and 1 deletion plus duplication), ranging from ∼700 bp

Fourteen of the 16 were only in a single RIL while 2 are shared in
several RILs and found to derive from a single F1 plant (no. 27)
(Materials and Methods) that segregated in F2 generations (SI
Appendix, Table S10). Of note, 12 of the 16 rearrangements have
mPings in close proximity to the break points, with 9 starting precisely at mPing sequences (Fig. 5, SI Appendix, Figs. S9 and S10, and
Table 2). Eleven mPing loci were identified at the break points of
these 9 rearrangements. Of these 11 loci, 5 were also characterized
as high frequency excision loci (SI Appendix, Table S11). The 9
rearrangements with mPing sequences at the break points were all
validated by PCR (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 and Table 2).
Close examination of these nine rearrangements implicate
aberrant transposition as the underlying mechanism. For example, transposase acting at the distal termini of mPings upstream
and downstream of rice gene LOC_Os02g47060 (Fig. 5A and SI
Appendix, Table S12) likely generated a megatransposon that
26292 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015736117

includes both elements and 8.1 kb of intervening DNA. Similarly,
termini of linked mPings appear to be involved in the deletion of
potential regulatory sequences upstream of LOC_Os01g51290
(Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Table S12) and intragenic sequences of
LOC_Os05g26140 (Fig. 5C and SI Appendix, Table S12) leaving
at the break point, a single mPing in the former and a rearranged
mPing in the latter. Deletion of sequences downstream of
LOC_Os03g12260 (Fig. 5D and SI Appendix, Table S12) also
correlates with the presence of tightly linked mPings although only
one mPing terminus appears to be directly involved in the rearrangement. Tightly linked mPings are also involved in distinct
intergenic rearrangements in RIL155 and RIL22, with the termini
of both mPings implicated in the former, but only one of the two in
the latter (Fig. 5E). The largest rearrangement with mPing at a
break point (a 56-kb deletion including two rice genes) (Fig. 5F
and SI Appendix, Table S12) involves only a single, unlinked mPing
that is derived from the NB parent. Its participation in a

rearrangement may be due to high transposase concentration—as
RIL198 has seven Pings (Table 2). In total, rearrangements were
associated with deletion of four protein-coding genes and partial
deletion of six protein-coding genes (SI Appendix, Table S12).
Discussion
In this study, RILs generated by crossing a bursting accession
and the reference NB were exploited to characterize the spread
of TEs through a small population and the resulting impact on
genome diversity. To quantify family (transposase) activity, the
number of new mPing insertions was used as a trait that varied
across the RILs. In this way, the number of new mPing insertions
per RIL served as a high-resolution proxy for Ping activity and
led to a deeper understanding of the features of this TE family
and its interaction with the host. To understand the impact on
gene and genome diversity, all Ping and mPing insertions were
localized, and a determination was made of their contribution to
structural variation (SV). Conclusions from these dual analyses
are summarized below.
Assessing Ping Activity.
Ping dosage. Prior studies of Ping activity were restricted to ac-

cessions, like NB, with a single Ping element, and the bursting
accessions, HEG4, EG4, A119, and A123, with 7 to 10 Pings (9).
Transposition of mPing was extremely rare in the former and
robust in the latter, with up to ∼40 new insertions per plant per
generation (7, 8). In this study, segregation of the eight parental
Ping loci generated lines with 0 to 8 Pings, often with many RILs
for each Ping dosage (SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2).
Variation in the number of new mPing insertions per RIL (0 to
138) led to the identification of two QTLs that each contain
multiple linked Ping elements: on chromosomes 1 (PingA and
PingB) and 9 (PingE, PingF, and PingG) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
That these QTLs contain the only linked Pings raises the question of whether their contribution to mPing transposition is due
to the effect of Ping dosage or something more subtle. We think
the former for the following reasons. First, RILs with PingC,
PingD, and PingH contain comparable numbers of new mPing
insertions as RILs with Ping loci identified by QTL mapping (SI
Chen et al.

Appendix, Fig. S6 B–G). This suggests that single Ping loci also
contribute to the dosage effect on transposition activity. Second,
two other bursting accessions (A119 and A123) with high Ping
copy numbers (7 and 10 respectively) only share the PingA locus
(9). That is, their bursts are robust even though they do not have
the two QTLs reported in this study. Thus, we conclude that
variation in the number of new mPing insertions across the RILs
reflects increasing Ping copy number (Fig. 2A) and Ping transcripts (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that incremental increases in Ping-encoded products promote incremental increases
in Ping activity. Just how high Ping dosage can be increased before activity plateaus is the goal of a future study to investigate
new RIL populations where both parents are in the midst of a
burst and many more Pings and mPings are segregating.
Individual Ping activity. Segregation of the seven (out of eight) Ping
loci (containing identical Ping elements) into single Ping-containing
RILs facilitated a comparative analysis of their ability to catalyze
mPing transposition. To overcome the limitation of low germinal
activity associated with single Ping-containing lines, we exploited the
higher frequency of somatic transposition coupled with deep sequencing. Consistent with prior studies where PingA was found to
be the only locus shared by all bursting and high copy accessions (9),
we found that PingA catalyzes more transposition than the other
Ping loci (Fig. 3). Although these data could be interpreted to mean
that the burst was initiated by higher PingA activity, future studies
are needed to determine the underlying mechanism.
Ping is not silenced. The Ping/mPing family was shown previously to
successfully amplify by eluding epigenetic silencing for decades
of sib- or self-pollination of bursting inbred lines (9). In this
study, we extend that finding by showing that this TE family
remains active after outcrossing (of a bursting accession to NB)
and subsequent rounds of sib- or self-pollination of the RIL
population. First, demonstration that there are no new insertions
of Pong, which is active but silenced (9), in any RIL indicates that
epigenetic regulation is maintained throughout the population
(Table 1 and SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2). Despite robust epigenetic regulation, all RIL with Ping elements, especially
lines with many Pings, have new mPing insertions, indicating that

Ping has not been silenced in any of these lines (SI Appendix,
Supplementary Data 2).
Data from this study provide important clues to why Ping activity has persisted in the population after outcrossing and why,
as the burst continues, it is increasingly unlikely to be silenced. A
prior study (9) demonstrated that, although mPing is recognized
by host epigenetic machinery, Ping is not silenced because mPing
does not harbor any of Ping’s coding sequences. Thus, only Ping
26294 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015736117

terminal sequences, that are shared with mPing, are methylated
(9). These results suggested that, for Ping to be silenced, it has to
transpose into a genomic region that generates small interfering
RNA (siRNA). Here, we show that Ping rarely transposes,
making Ping silencing unlikely. Only 17 new Ping insertions were
detected among the RIL population—compared to over 14,000
new mPing insertions (SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2). A
close examination of the RILs with transposed Pings identified

Genome Instability as the Burst Continues. If the burst is not likely
to end with Ping silencing, how will it end? Data from this study
strongly suggest that increases in mPing copy number destabilize
the genome by elevating the chances of potentially deleterious
SV. TEs have long been known to generate SVs. The first TE
discovered by McClintock, Dissociation (Ds), was initially detected as a site of chromosome breakage (29). These so-called
“breaking” Ds elements are a structurally distinct minority of
characterized elements, often composed of tightly linked Ds
copies (30, 31). Double-Ds elements form frequently because of
the preference of the Ac transposase to catalyze local transposition (32, 33). Similar local hops and chromosome breakage are
associated with TEs from all three kingdoms, including the
Drosophila P and the bacterial Tn10 elements (34, 35).
In contrast, Ping does not promote local transposition of
mPing as new insertions from a single integrated donor site in
transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, yeast, and soybean were not
linked to that site (16, 36, 37). In operational terms, this means
that mPing bursts scatter copies randomly throughout the genome,
with only a few near existing insertion sites. However, as the burst
continues, the probability that new insertions will be linked to
existing mPing elements increases. Whether linked mPing elements
are more likely to generate SVs was investigated in the RIL population in two ways: 1) by quantifying the relative frequencies of
parental mPing excisions, and 2) by identifying SVs in the RIL
population and determining whether any had mPing at one or both
break points. For the analysis of excisions, the RILs were scored for
the frequency of excision among the 466 parental mPing loci. The
fact that 7 of the 12 loci with five or more excisions had another
mPing within 10 kb suggests that tightly linked elements are unusually active with regard to transposition (SI Appendix, Table S7).
Whether higher transposition activity also contributes to the
formation of a subset of SVs was assessed by identifying deletions
and small duplications among the RILs. As mentioned in Results, a
limitation of this analysis is that the use of short sequence reads
precludes the identification of inversions and many larger SVs.
Overall, 16 SVs were detected, and 9 were shown to have mPing at
one (4 of 9) or both (5 of 9) break points (Table 2). Furthermore,
the positions of the break points—at mPing termini—implicate Ping
transposase activity in SV formation. This situation is reminiscent of
the occurrence of Ds breakage only if Ac is in the genome (29), and
that aberrant transposition is the likely mechanism (38, 39).
Conclusions and Implications. While most genomic changes resulting
from TE bursts are likely neutral or deleterious, the results of this
study suggest that there may be an evolutionary benefit to the host
when a TE family bursts, scattering copies throughout the genome. Specifically, continued mPing amplification increases the
number of tightly linked elements, which, in turn, increases the
number of functionally relevant SVs upon which selection can act.
Most of the SVs reported in this study are deletions that are
Chen et al.

unlikely to be of evolutionary benefit. However, this limitation
probably reflects the use of short read sequences that have been
reported to miss most of the SVs larger than 2 kb, including duplications and inversions (40). In fact, a prior study that compared
the assembled genomes of two virtually identical rice accessions
undergoing independent mPing bursts, HEG4 and EG4, detected
an inversion of ∼120 kb with mPings at the break points (9).
The significance of this finding is that it provides a TE-mediated
mechanism that may generate much of the SVs represented by
pan-genomes in plants and other organisms (41, 42). Specifically,
it is generally accepted that a species, or even a population, cannot
be adequately represented by a single reference genome (43).
Rather, members of a species share core genes, but variation exists
in the form of sequence rearrangements that alter so-called dispensable (or accessory) gene content. Associations of dispensable
genomic regions with more TEs suggest that TEs are involved in
generating observed presence, absence, and copy number variations (44). However, until this study, the only evidence was correlative; questions remained concerning when and how TEs
generate the raw material for pan-genomes. Here, we demonstrate
that “when” is during an active TE burst, and “how” is through the
scattering of tightly linked elements throughout the gene space,
thereby seeding the genome with regions susceptible to transposase mediated SVs. One could imagine that, in a sufficiently
large population undergoing similar bursts, SVs that involve
components of the core genome will be eliminated by negative
selection while SVs that alter dispensable genes could be retained
in the population.
Materials and Methods
RIL Plants, DNA Extractions, and Sequencing. RILs were developed through a
single-seed descent approach from the F2 generation of a cross between
NB (maternal parent) and an mPing active accession HEG4 (paternal parent)
(see details in Fig. 1). RIL seeds were germinated at 37 °C and moved to soil
5 d after germination. Seedlings of 3-wk-old plants were harvested to extract genomic DNA using the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
method (45). Purified genomic DNA was fragmented to 300 bp using a
Covaris S220 Ultrasonicator (Covaris), and paired-end libraries were constructed using an Illumina TruSeq DNA sample prep kit (Illumina) or KAPA
LTP library preparation kit (Kapa Biosystems). Libraries were multiplexed
and sequenced on HiSeq 2500 or NextSeq 500 (Illumina).
RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR. RILs were grown as described above. Seedlings of
3-wk-old plants were used to extract total RNAs using the RNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen). Total RNAs were treated with amplification-grade RNase-free
DNase I (Qiagen) to remove contaminating DNAs. The treated DNA-free
total RNAs were reverse transcribed into complementary DNAs (cDNAs) using SuperScript III first-strand supermix (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNAs
were used as templates to perform qRT-PCR with iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad) on a CFX96 system (Bio-Rad). Transcript levels of ORF1 and TPase
were normalized to rice actin. Primers for qRT-PCR are in SI Appendix,
Supplementary Data 4.
Construction of Recombination Bin and Linkage Map. A total of 105,900 SNPs
between parental accessions HEG4 and NB were identified and filtered using
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (46) as described previously (9). Highquality SNPs were used to genotype the RILs and a hidden Markov model
(HMM) algorithm was applied to construct recombination bins (22). Briefly,
paired-end reads of each RIL were mapped to the NB reference genome
(MSUv7) by Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) aligner v0.6.2 (21, 47). Read
alignments were sorted, and PCR duplicates were removed using MarkDuplicate as implemented in PicardTools (broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).
Potential SNP sites were identified by the GATK toolkit following the best
practice workflow of GATK (46). Only SNP sites matching parental SNPs were
considered as informative sites. A genotyping error rate of 1.4% was estimated by counting the number of incorrectly genotyped SNPs from independently sequenced parental samples, NB and HEG4. Of these 105,900
SNPs, 1,311 were misgenotyped as HEG4 or heterozygous SNPs in the NB
sample (864 HEG4 and 447 heterozygous, respectively) whereas 1,656 were
misgenotyped as NB or heterozygous SNPs in the HEG4 sample (333 NB and
1,323 heterozygous, respectively). The resulting RIL SNP genotypes were
imported into the R environment to construct a recombination bin map

from 21 to 96 new mPing insertions, including 4 to 60 heterozygous insertions that are likely to be new and provide evidence
of recent activity (SI Appendix, Table S3). In addition, of the 17
new Ping insertion sites, 14 are into euchromatic loci and 3 into
heterochromatin (SI Appendix, Table S3). Among this latter class
(which is more likely to silence Ping), new mPing insertions vary
from 63 (21 are heterozygous) to 67 (15 are heterozygous) to 111
(15 are heterozygous), again inconsistent with the loss of Ping
activity (SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 2).
Taken together, these data suggest that, as the burst continues,
the ratio of mPing to Ping copies will increase—which is likely to
further decrease the frequency of Ping transposition and its
subsequent silencing. In addition, the finding that the single SNP
adjacent to its terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) makes mPing a
better substrate for transposase than Ping (15) will further reduce the chances of Ping silencing as the burst continues.

using the HMM approach as described in the Maximum Parsimony of Recombination (MPR) package (22). The expected proportion of genotypes for
each locus was 49.75:0.50:49.75, with an error rate of 1.4%. Recombinant
bins were used as markers, and the missing data were imputed using an
argmax method in the R/qtl package (48). A linkage map was built using the
haldane function in the R/qtl package (48).

RILs or HEG4, were identified by RelocaTE2 (25). Briefly, RelocaTE2 identified
paired-end read pairs that match the ends of mPing (junction reads) or internal sequences of mPing (supporting reads) using BLAT (49). After trimming mPing sequences, the remaining sequences from the original read
pairs were searched against MSUv7 by BWA v0.6.2 to identify potential
mPing insertions either present in the reference genome or in the RILs. Raw
results from RelocaTE2 were filtered by removing mPing insertions with
junction reads from only one end or mPing insertions without 3 bp target
site duplications (TSDs), which is a hallmark of mPing transposition. Heterozygous mPing insertions were characterized by analyzing BAM files of
raw read pairs aligned to MSUv7 (50). These mPing insertions with reads
aligned to both sides of the flanking sequences were characterized as heterozygous mPing insertions. Ping copy number in RILs was characterized as
described for mPing. Read pairs from each mPing/Ping insertion site were
analyzed to distinguish mPing and Ping sequence differences. All candidate
Ping insertions were confirmed by PCR or Southern blot.
Determination of mPing Insertion Sites in Single-Ping RILs. Two experimental
approaches (transposon display and pooled DNA sequencing) were performed on multiple individuals to determine de novo mPing insertions.
Because mPing transpositions are rare in single-Ping RILs, multiple individuals were pooled to maximize detection of new insertions catalyzed by
each Ping.
Transposon display. Single-Ping RILs used in the experiment were as follows:
PingA: RIL60; PingB: RIL179; PingC: RIL230, RIL234, RIL43; PingD: RIL100,
RIL25, RIL75; PingE: RIL268, RIL45; PingG: RIL12, RIL47; and PingH: RIL156,
RIL166, RIL259. Genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB method (45).
Transposon display of mPing was performed on eight progeny of each RIL as
described (51). Briefly, 50 ng of genomic DNA was digested with MseI and
ligated with adapters overnight at 37 °C. Preselective amplifications were
performed with primers complementary to the adapters (MseI + 0) and internal mPing sequences (mPing P1). Selective amplifications were performed
with one selective base of the adapter primer (MseI + T/A/G/C) and mPing P2
primers. PCR reactions were loaded on 6% denaturing acrylamidebisacrylamide gels to visualize mPing transpositions. New bands that are
present exclusively in one individual are counted as de novo mPing insertions. Transposition frequency of mPing was calculated using the number of
new mPing insertions per individual from all of the selective primer combinations. The primers for transposon display are in SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 4.
Pooled DNA sequencing. Single-Ping RILs used in the experiment were as follows: PingA: RIL60; PingC: RIL230; PingD: RIL99; PingE: RIL268; PingG: RIL12;
and PingH: RIL156. Genomic DNA from 7 to 9 plants per RIL were extracted
and fragmented as described above, and paired-end libraries were constructed with the KAPA LTP library preparation kit. Libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 or NextSeq 500. Three or four
biological replicates were performed for each experiment. RelocaTE2 was
employed to identify mPing insertion sites in each sequence replicate. Only
heterozygous mPing insertions that are exclusively present in one replicate
were counted as de novo insertions.
Analysis of mPing Excision Events. Parental mPing insertions segregating in
the RILs were identified. First, 51 mPing insertions exclusively in NB or shared
between HEG4 and NB were identified as parental mPing loci. These loci
have allele frequencies of ∼50% (35 to 55%) for 44 NB-specific mPing loci or
∼90% (89 to 95%) for 7 shared mPing loci. Second, 415 nonreference mPing
insertions were identified from four independent sequenced HEG4 libraries
(Sequence Read Archive [SRA] accession numbers: SRR1619147, SRR833485,
SRR833529, and SRR1619373). Determination of the allele frequency of the

415 mPing loci in the RILs revealed that they were present in more than 10%
of the 272 RILs (ranging from 16 to 74%), suggesting these mPing loci were
segregating in the population. Together, these 466 mPing loci were used as
parental mPing loci in the analysis.
The recombination bin map and SNPs that distinguish the parental genotypes were used to phase the haplotypes of mPing loci in each RIL. Empty
mPing loci within an NB or HEG4 haplotype were considered as potential
excision sites and further confirmed by analyzing the alignments of reads
covering the mPing insertion sites. Excisions were characterized only if there
were two or more reads covering the 20 bp flanking an mPing insertion.
Footprints of excision events were characterized by small insertion/deletions
(indels) in the Compact Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report (CIGAR)
alignments. Two approaches were applied to identify independent excision
events: 1) a standard method that counts each excision as an independent
event assuming that all RILs are independent; 2) a conservative method that
counts independent excisions from each locus according to the configuration of footprints in each RIL. Excisions that have the same footprint were
counted as dependent events. A binomial test was used to test for the significance of high excision frequency mPing insertions based on a frequency
of 0.0051 excision events per locus per plant. Two methods identified similar
sets of mPing loci with high frequency excision events (SI Appendix, Table
S13). Excisions of high excision frequency mPing loci identified by both the
standard method and conservative method were manually inspected and
confirmed by a PCR approach.
Structural Variation in the RILs and Proximity to mPing Elements. A bioinformatics approach was employed to detect potential sequence rearrangements in the RILs. Only deletions could be identified with confidence because of
the limitations associated with the resolution of short reads (75 bp and 100 bp in
this study) and small insertion size libraries (∼200 bp in this study). CNVnator
was used to analyze the read depth of bam alignment files in 272 RILs (28). A
series of filters were used to obtain high-confident deletions from the raw
results of CNVnator: 1) considering only those regions with normalized read
depth less than 0.05 as candidate deletions; 2) excluding centromeres, telomere chromosome ends, and low coverage regions in NB and HEG4 genomes;
and 3) any candidate regions should have at least one read supporting the
junction of at least one end of deletions. Candidate SVs were further analyzed
by a PCR approach or sequencing with additional primers (SI Appendix, Supplementary Data 4).
Differential Gene Expression Analysis. RNAseq reads from NB and HEG4 were
obtained from SRA BioProject PRJNA264731. Each sample has three biological
replicates with 51 nucleotide (nt) single-end reads. Reads were aligned to
MSUv7 with tophat v2.1.1 (52) using default parameters. Read counts of
protein-coding genes were estimated by the htseq-count tool from HTSeq
v0.7.2 (53). Differential gene expression analysis was performed with edgeR
v2.99.8 (54) using the generalized linear model (GLM). Genes with a false
discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05 were reported as differentially expressed genes.
Statistical Analysis. Pearson’s correlation test, Mann–Whitney U test, oneway ANOVA, and Tukey’s HSD test were performed in R with “cor.test,”
“wilcox.test,” “aov,” and “TukeyHSD” functions. Samples sizes, statistical
tests, and P values are described in figures or figure legends.
